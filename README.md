# image_scraper

![Ruby](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/image_scraper/workflows/Ruby/badge.svg)

Simple utility that pulls image URLS from web page

## INSTALL

Add to your gemfile

    gem "image_scraper"

Install w/ Bundler

    bundle install

## USAGE

Initialize the image scraper client

    image_scraper = ImageScraper::Client.new("http://www.rubygems.org")

You can also pass an options hash to the client when you initialize it:

    image_scraper = ImageScraper::Client.new("http://www.rubygems.org", options)
    # OPTIONS - If you don't pass the option, it will default to true
    # :convert_to_absolute_url - If there are relative image URLS, it will convert them to absolute URLS.
    # :include_css_images - If there are stylesheets on the page, it will pull images out of the stylesheet.  For example: background: url(/images/some-image.png).
    # :include_css_data_images - Will include data images from CSS.  For example: data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAOALMAAOazToeH............

Get the images from the url specified when you initialized the client:

    image_scraper.image_urls

This will return an array of strings.
